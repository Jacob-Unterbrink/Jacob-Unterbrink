Hello, 

My name is Jacob Unterbrink, and I'm a graduate of the University of Missouri. I double majored in economics (with honors) and statistics, while receiving 
minors in mathematics, political science, and business. I have since enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma where I'm pursuing a master's 
degree in data science and analytics. While I have a broad range of academic interests, I spend the majority of my time applying data science tools to economic and healthcare issues, as well as sports. I anticipate graduating this May.

In my free time I love to run, read, and watch sports. Additionally, I really enjoy meeting and getting to know new people. Feel free to contact me at jacobunterbrink@ou.edu
